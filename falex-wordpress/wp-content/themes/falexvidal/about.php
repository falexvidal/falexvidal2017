                          <p>My name is Francisco Alexandre, also known as (F)alex. I’m a Digital Designer born in Brazil, but currently based in Toronto, ON, Canada.</p>
                          <p>I’m currently attending Interactive Media Design program at Seneca – York college campus, and my goal is having new experiences in Toronto, which include meeting new people, starting new partnerships and maybe finding my own voice here.</p>
                          <p>Living in a city like Toronto is like a dream come true. There is a massive design scene here, as well as lots of spaces and events developed by – and for designers.</p>
